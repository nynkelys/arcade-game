## Project

In this game you have a player and enemies. The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies, the bugs, which move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Once the player reaches the water, he levels up. However, once a the player collides with a bug, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
